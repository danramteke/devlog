title: Symbolicating RubyMotion Crash Logs

When receiving a crash log via email, use [atos](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/atos.1.html) to find the line numbers in RubyMotion. Here is how.

After running `rake device`, a bunch of files are created in the build directory under the build target, including a `.dSYM` file. Go ahead and `cd` into that directory, I'll be typing all commands from that directory. Here is an example of my `build/iPhoneOS-7.0-Development` directory: ![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Nas5e5N.png) 

Here is the crash log I'll be using ![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/HLXbG1I.png) ![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/vryfvTl.png)

Here is the command I typed: `atos -l 0xed000 -arch armv7 0x00a22a30 0x00a22b56 0x0098caec 0x00a20866 0x00a0a930 0x00a09a66 0x00a0a420 0x0080b524 0x0081241e 0x008124ae -o Redacted\ \(Dev\).dSYM/Contents/Resources/DWARF/Redacted\ \(Dev\) -d`

The `-l` bit is taken from the Binary Images section. That first number there.

The `-arch` is the architecture to use. Here, it's `armv7` since the crash happened on device.

The rest of the hex numbers are taken from the first screen shot of the crash log. I copy/pasted them from the crash log for now (would like to hear of a better way). And I got this output:

    got symbolicator for Redacted (Dev).dSYM/Contents/Resources/DWARF/Redacted (Dev), base address 4000
    __vm_raise() (in Redacted (Dev)) + 276
    rb_vm_raise (in Redacted (Dev)) + 82
    rb_frozen_class_p (in Redacted (Dev)) + 72
    rb_vm_method_missing (in Redacted (Dev)) + 358
    rb_vm_dispatch (in Redacted (Dev)) + 3060
    rb_vm_trigger_method_missing (in Redacted (Dev)) + 522
    rb_vm_dispatch (in Redacted (Dev)) + 1764
    vm_fast_plus (in Redacted (Dev)) + 356
    __unnamed_28 (in Redacted (Dev)) + 274
    rb_scope__commandDidStart:__ (in Redacted (Dev)) (login_view_controller.rb:56)
    
As you can see, the crash was in Facebook log in code.


I'm not happy about having to copy/paste the addresses into the command line. But I am happy that I was able to get a line number in ruby code (although off by one) from an otherwise opaque crash log intended for Xcode.
